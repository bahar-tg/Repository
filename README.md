This is a very simple project which is meant to get three lengths with the same unit and evaluates whether these lengths can create triangle or not.In a wpf window, there are three textBoxes which the users fills them as lengths of triangle and by pressing "Calculate" button the triangle type will be shown to her. If users enters wrong value, a message box shows a proper message to user.
